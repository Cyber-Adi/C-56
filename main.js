It holds the title of the world’s longest manmade structure, and is testament to wall building techniques found as early as the 7th century B.C., when its dynasty-spanning construction began.")

Designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, this huge statue on Corcovado Mountain cost around $250,000 to build, most of which was given in donation. Though the statue has been damaged by lightning, weather and other natural conditions over the years, restoration efforts have kept it largely intact.")

  window.alert("Built in the 15th century by the Incas of Peru, the pyramid city of Machu Picchu was abandoned only a century after its creation during the Spanish Conquest. Since conquistadors never discovered this Lost City of the Incas, it remained largely untouched until its rediscovery in 1911, making it a uniquely preserved and important historical artifact. This lost city features many classic Incan building techniques and has taught us a great deal of what we know about Incan civilization today. A century of careful restoration on many of the buildings allows tourists to see what many of the structures originally looked like, and restoration efforts continue to this day.")

It represents one of the greatest architectural and engineering feats ever accomplished by mankind, and was built in a span of just 10 years, reaching completion in 80 A.D. Partially ruined by natural disasters and stone robbers, it remains one of the most iconic symbols of Rome and of Italy.")

This ancient city, carved and built from the living rock possibly as early as 300 B.C., is often called the Rose City because of the pale red hue of the stone from which it was carved. Although Petra is a carefully protected and treasured site, it remained unknown in the Western world until the early 1800s, and was only designated a World Heritage Site very recently. Its inclusion as one of the New Seven Wonders has increased awareness and tourism dramatically.")
